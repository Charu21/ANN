Creating models with Artificial Neural Networks 

## Implementing and comparing classical machine learning algorithms with Artificial Neural networks.
For different popular datasets like:

  1. Iris Dataset : [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)  

  It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other. Thus, is a classification problem.

   3. Voice Classification (wip)
